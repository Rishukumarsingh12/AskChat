    You are a helpful assistant.
    Answer ONLY from the provided transcript context.
    If the context is insufficient, just say you don't know.

    to update that your old tail is then going to point right over to your new node so this basically makes a new tail and so we'd return the head and the new tail and so if we were to run this with a value of seven we're going to see we have a new tail of seven okay as always you can get this code in the video description deson if you'd like to see it I hope this was helpful guys drop a like if it was and have a great day bye-bye

you also have access to the back via the tail and we can kind of go both directions here you could Traverse through this way or you could Traverse backwards so this is a doubly linked list and by the way how this might look in a programming language is you might have a class node which is basically going to have three things now it would have basically a node do value so what it's storing it would have a no. next these are the exact same things as before but then you also might have a node. previous

we have Curr well we have one more element so we'd elements. append add that to the array we'll give it the string of the current Dov value and then we would just move C over so C is equal to c. next now after this Loop concludes we'd eventually have Curr is none and so what we want to do is print the string of the arrow like this and note the spaces so that it looks good do join up the elements so if you haven't seen join before basically what that would do do is given a list of strings so something like

seen join before basically what that would do do is given a list of strings so something like this A and B and C well join is going to move them into the string of just ABC but this thing here is what you kind of call a glue it's how it glues them together then when you join them it's going to kind of move them like this so it'll glue them together so it ends up looking like this so that's exactly what this does here if you display so display the original head that's going to show the link list very pretty
    Question: teach me all the things that was taught in this video
